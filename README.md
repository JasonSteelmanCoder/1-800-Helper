# 1-800-Helper
This is a program meant to help someone find an available 1800 number for their organization.

The program has three main tools for the user:
- Find the number for a word that the user enters
- Using GPT, suggest words based on the user's description of their organization
- Give a sampling of available 1800 numbers alongside all of the words that they can spell

Whenever the program suggests an available number, that number is clickable. When they click a number, the user will be asked if they want to purchase the number. The numbers' availability, and the buying process are mocked, since this is meant to be a learning exercise.
